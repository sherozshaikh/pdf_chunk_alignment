## PDF Chunk Matching with NLP Techniques

### Overview

Welcome to the PDF Chunk Matching repository! This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to compare and align chunks of text extracted from two PDF files (PDF1 and PDF2). Each chunk represents a segment of text from the document, facilitating detailed analysis and document alignment.

### Multiple Model Integration

- **Word2Vec**: Traditional word embeddings.
- **Sentence Transformers**: Embeddings optimized for semantic similarity.
- **Pre-Trained Models (BERT/GPT)**: Contextualized embeddings for fine-grained meaning.
- **TF-IDF**: A basic measure of word relevance.
- **Spacy Model**: Utilizes syntactic and semantic features.
- **LASER**: Multilingual sentence embeddings for cross-linguistic comparisons.

### Final Weighted Score Generation

- Aggregate results from multiple models.
- Assign higher weights to outputs from advanced models like BERT.
- Balance accuracy and computational efficiency for diverse analytical needs.

### Example

Consider a scenario:
- PDF1: Technical report on renewable energy projects.
- PDF2: Funding proposal for similar projects.
  
Using this script:
- Align project specifications from PDF1 with funding requirements in PDF2.
- Determine overlap and discrepancies using cosine similarity scores.
